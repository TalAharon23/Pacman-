# ----- PACMAN GAME ----- 
     by Tal Aharon

This game was developed as part of a bachelor's degree in computer science at Tel Aviv-Jaffa College.

The game is developed in C++, using object-oriented programming, polymorphism and files.

The game has 3 options:
1) Normal game - Reading the game board template. During the game and between the boards, the user's steps and game results are saved into a file.
2) View the saved game from the file and run it on the screen per board.
3) Checking the game - reading the steps and moves of the game, while checking in front of the file, test that everything is done properly and that the game board is correct.
