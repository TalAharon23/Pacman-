     by Tal Aharon

This game was developed as part of a bachelor's degree in computer science at Tel Aviv-Jaffa College.

The game developed with C++, using object-oriented programming, polymorphism and files.

The Pacman has 3 game options:

   - Reading one or more gameboard templates from the project folder. 
   - During the game and according to the playing board, the user's steps and game's results are saving into a file.
3) View the whole saved game from a file and run it on the screen.
4) Testing the game:
   - reading the game's steps and results.
   - Checking in front of the files that everything is done properly and that the game board is correct.
   - Printing the test's result (succeed or not).
